# Angle-based lazy triggering

When the player's view angle of a chunk changes enough it triggers. This can be done rarely if the chunk is far away or on the axis of the player's movement. The trigger events are marked with blue flashes and the chunks are colored green the more they are triggered.

Instructions: Click and drag for movement
